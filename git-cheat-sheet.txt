This File will be a refrence for me if I get lost in Git Later.

We have 4 stages. 
- Workspace 
- Index (Stage)
- Local repository (Head)
- Remote repository


1. To get the file from exected repository:
  $ git clone <URL>
2. To add the changes from workspace to index we use: 
  $ git add <File>
3. To check the status of our git repository in which stage:
  $ git status
4. To add the changes from index to Local repository: 
  $ git commit
5. To check what is got updated between Local repository & Workspace
  $ git diff HEAD
6. To check what got updated between Index & Workspace in spicific file
  $ git diff <File Name>
